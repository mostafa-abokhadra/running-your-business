# branding
**your brand shows:**
- who you are
- what you stand for

A brand is much more than a name, logo and tagline.

It's **what comes to mind** when existing and potential customers think of you. It answers the question:

- What do you want to be known for?
- what your customers think and feel about your brand
- how they identify, recognise and experience your business.

**A brand is made up of 2 elements**:
- **tangible** (e.g. premises, uniforms, campaigns)
- **intangible** (e.g. reputation, service, behaviour).

a brand is simply a collection of perceptions in the mind of the consumer.

# Business and personal brand
the face of the brand is the founder, owner or leader. It's important that there's a natural and logical association between your business and personal brand.
